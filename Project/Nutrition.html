			      Nutrition in the body is always our theme, and more specifically for the new GYM training, nutrition knowledge in particular and all the bodybuilding knowledge in general is very limited. In this article, I only cover the most basic issues in bodybuilding and step by step help you change the habits of eating and drinking for the work life.
			   </strong>
			</header>
			<p>
			  Exercise is the first necessary condition for muscle to develop and bring about a change in appearance, but nutrition is enough to determine whether you succeed or fail. People want to live and work should eat, but eat how to eat is not wise people do not know. Of course you are new, so I will not mention the technical terms to catch you have to calculate the required calories, BMR index and set yourself a menu. After all you have full bodybuilding knowledge then you will naturally do. Now, you just have to change a little bit about your nutritional habits that everything is fine.
			</p>

		    <h2>Carbonhydrate - Protein - Fat</h2>
		  </div>
		  <p>
		    <strong>Carbonhydrate, starch</strong> These are the different names of the same substance that we later called carb, which is what we eat the most in our lives, the things you usually eat like rice, rice, bread rice noodles, rice noodles, rice noodles, rice noodles, rice noodles, rice noodles, rice noodles ... We control them not good, it is easy to cause obesity, for this you should note <strong> Absolutely not eat sweets: sweet candy, soft drinks, sugar drinks</strong>
		  </p>
		     <strong>Protein </strong>  This is a very important substance in the development of muscle, protein is present in the meat, fish, eggs, milk. You need to eat this type of food to meet the needs of the body, but should eat lean meat (low fat) to maintain health and maintain athletic performance.
		  <p>
		  <p>
		    <strong>Fat </strong>  This is both a friend and a foe for us, you absolutely should not eat saturated fat or animal fat (except marine fat is a good fat is good for the heart). Keep in mind that fat in your daily diet, a small amount of fat also gives you a great deal of calories that affect your weight management.
		  <div class="headline headline-md">
		     <h2>Why increase or lose weight</h2>
		  </div>
		  <p>
		    The three substances in our body produce an energy level, if this level of energy is higher than what we need, they will accumulate in the form of fat, we will be fat, This amount is smaller than we need to lose weight. Therefore, it is not easy to eat what is right for us. Have you asked me how to do weight training? How do you lose weight? The problem lies in this place of nutrition. Thereby, you will find that bodybuilding, GYM, fitness is a miracle method to help the sick to gain weight, fat people lose weight, the body just getting better ... the important thing is to know Nutrition for the right purpose. After this I will write more articles in depth with the bodybuilding nutritional expertise, and the new bodybuilding, do not hurry to be patient!
		  </p>
		  <div class="headline headline-md">
		     <h2>Change eating habits</h2>
		  </div>
		  <p>
		     <strong>Eat 6 meals a day</strong> Vietnamese eating habits are every 3 hours of breakfast, lunch and dinner. In Saigon, there is one more night meal, which is not good at all. Why so? Before I eat wrong? Sorry to inform you that you are wrong. Do you see? Bodybuilding now brings you a smart eating concept. The food is not naturally absorbed but needs to be digested through the digestive tract from the tooth to the intestine. Do you chew gum a lot when you have teeth? Your body needs to have different digestive enzymes to digest food, and unfortunately the enzyme volume is limited at one time so that the food you eat at one time will not be digested. Eat out, cause a waste and your digestive system will have to handle and eliminate the food. This is unwise first.
             Now I suppose that you absorb 100% of that food into the body at the same time with a large amount of energy generated in the body, our body will "save" a little, a little will turn into reserve fat. This is the second wild I want to say. It would be nothing if we split the meal into six meals and each meal was 3-4 hours apart and did not eat well.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    <strong>Eat all the ingredients in one meal </strong>  This is extremely important, many people think that a glass of mulberry is a meal is not right, a meal here must be full of ingredients: protein, carbohydrates and fat in a certain ratio, ie In your meal you must have starches (rice, noodles, noodles ... green vegetables, fruits), protein (meat, fish, eggs, milk ...) and a small amount of fat. Omega-3 fats are good for the heart. Of course, do not eat well, near the full is okay

		    <strong>Say no to alcohol</strong>  If you ever drink alcohol, please take a 24-hour break to the gymnasium offline, if not dangerously unpredictable impact on his life. If you are to avoid alcoholic drinks, it is not good for training

		    <figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Drink enough water</figcaption></figure>
		  </div>
		  <p>
		     <strong>Drink plenty of water</strong>  Drink water whenever possible, maintain large amounts of water in the body that will be good for you. You will understand why when you step through the first 2 months
		  </p>	
		  <p>
		    <strong>Eat more fruits, vegetables</strong>  To provide vitamins and fiber, you need to eat a variety of different fruits and vegetables to balance your diet, but you should not eat too much fruit that tastes sweet.
		  </p>
		  <div class = "headline headline-md">
		    <h2>Eat for every purpose</h2>
		  </div>
		  <p>
		    <strong>Eat to gain weight</strong> You come to GYM to gain weight? this is easy Now you eat a little more than before. For example, before you eat 3 cups of rice, you now have 3 cups and 4 cups later. This is the simplest way but sometimes the problem lies in your absorption. It is best to have a diet that supports weight gain

			 </figure>
		  </div>
		  <p>
		    <strong>Eat to lose weight</strong>This problem seems to be a little bit more difficult: You need to eat a little less than the previous day so your body gets used to the lack of energy, which in turn will burn off your fat. However, in the first two months you do not hurry to think how much will reduce. At this time, your bodybuilding experience and your ability to adapt are not high. You keep practicing the practice, when the cabinet is quite good, 10kg a month is not a problem for you.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    <strong>Eat to stay fit</strong>You do not need to eat more or less than the present, you just need to restructure the meal, you should push the protein up a bit and reduce the amount of carb and fat down a bit. Is the problem too simple?
		  </p>
		  <div class = "headline headline-md">
		    <h2></b>Food supplements: should or should not?</b></h2>
		  </div>
		  <p>
		    During this 2 month period you probably do not need to use energy supplements in your workout, but protein supplements should be used if you are able to achieve a healthy diet. better. As mentioned above if you need to gain weight then choose <b>Muscle Mass Gainer</b>, , If you want to maintain a healthy and well-balanced body, reduce excess muscle fat, use it <b>lean Body MRP</b> or <b>Elite Fusion 7</b>. You can also use <b>Super Amino 6000</b> to increase the absorption of food by taking pre-meals or help with muscle recovery after exercise.
